              ey! I&apos;m Ryan, if you haven&apos;t already gathered that by
              now. I specialize in frontend development, primarily React.js, but
              I also have experience with backend technologies like Node.js and
              Express.js. I live in Greenville, SC.

              I&apos;m currently working on several projects, including a chat
              application called Push It. I enjoy taking on new challenges and
              learning new technologies to build efficient and scalable
              applications.

              Outside of coding, I have a passion for fishing and often spend my
              weekends on the water. I also enjoy tinkering with my vehicleâ€™s
              sound system and exploring the latest tech gadgets.
